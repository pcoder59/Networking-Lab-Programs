Server
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Create a UDP Socket
Step 3: Enter Port Number
Step 4: Bind Port to UDP Socket
Step 5: Obtain Window Size from Client
Step 6: Obtain Total Packets from Network Layer
Step 7: Send Total Packets to the Client
Step 8: Set i = 0, frame = 0
Step 9: While i is less than Total Packets, repeat steps 10 to 16
Step 10: Store packets from i to i + windowsize or upto total - 1 in frame to be sent
Step 11: Send frame to Client
Step 12: Receive Acknowledgement from Client
Step 13: Check Acknowledgement. If a packet has negative Acknowledgement, go to step 14. Else go to step 16
Step 14: Print Negative Acknowledgement Received for Packet
Step 15: Set i as Packet number of the negative packet. Increment Frame. Go to step 9
Step 16: Print "All Packets in Frame Received", set i as last packet + 1, increment frame. Go to step 9
Step 17: Print "Transmission Complete"
Step 18: Close UDP Socket
Step 19: Stop
