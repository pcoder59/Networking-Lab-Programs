Server
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Create a UDP Socket
Step 3: Enter Port Number
Step 4: Bind Port to UDP Socket
Step 5: Initialize frame_id of first frame to 0
Step 6: Receive number of frames from client
Step 7: While frame_id is less than number of frames, repeate steps 8 to 13
Step 8: Receive frame from client
Step 9: If Received frame is valid, go to step 10. Else, go to step 13
Step 10: Display Received frame
Step 11: Send frame with sequence number equal to frame_id of Received frame and ack = sequence number + 1
Step 12: Print "Ack Sent", increment frame_id and go to step 7
Step 13: Print "Ack Not Received", and go to step 7
Step 14: Close UDP Socket
Step 15: Stop

client
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Create a UDP Socket
Step 3: Enter Port Number
Step 4: Bind Port to UDP Socket
Step 5: Initialize frame_id of first frame to 0
Step 6: Set Ack to 1
Step 7: Enter Number of frames
Step 8: Send Number of frames to Server
Step 9: While frame_id is less than number of frames, repeat steps 10 to 16
Step 10: If Ack is 1, go to step 11. Else go to step 13
Step 11: Set sequence number of frame to be sent as frame_id 
Step 12: Enter data for frame
Step 13: Send the frame to Server
Step 14: Receive frame from Server
Step 12: If Received frame is valid, go to step 13. Else go to step 15
Step 13: Print "Ack Received"
Step 14: Set Ack to 1, increment frame_id and go to step 9
Step 15: Print "Ack Not Received"
Step 16: Set Ack to 0 and go to step 10
Step 17: Close UDP Socket
Step 18: Stop
