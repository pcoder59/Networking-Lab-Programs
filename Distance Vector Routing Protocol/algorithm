Step 1: Start
Step 2: Enter number of Nodes
Step 3: Enter the cost Matrix
Step 4: Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each node and go to Step 7
Step 5: Initialize distance to cost Matrix
Step 6: Set node from which distance is calculated
Step 7: Repeat Steps 8 - 10 for each Nodes and go to step 11
Step 8: Choose an arbitary vertex k
Step 9: Add Distance k to Node j
Step 10: If Distance is less than current distance, set distance from k as new distance and node from which distance is calculated as k
Step 11: Print Distance to every node
Step 12: Stop
